HSReplay is a replay format for [Hearthstone](http://playhearthstone.com/).

It is an XML-based format, with a structure closely mirroring that of the
game's protocol.

The extension for HSReplay files is `.hsreplay`.
The MIME Type is `application/vnd.hearthsim-hsreplay+xml`.


## Implementations

A Python reference implementation is available. It contains capabilities
for reading the `Power.log` file generated by Hearthstone when logging
is enabled.

For more information, see
[How to enable logging](https://github.com/jleclanche/fireplace/wiki/How-to-enable-logging).

If you are interested in developing reference implementations in other
languages, please get in touch through our `#hearthsim` channel (see below).
